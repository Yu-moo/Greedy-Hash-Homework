Pytorch implementation for "Greedy Hash: Towards Fast Optimization for Accurate Hash Coding in CNN" (NIPS2018).

- running environment: pytorch 0.3 and python 2.7

- please run several times and take the average (as the result is a little bit unstable)

- you can download the ImageNet dataset [here](https://github.com/thuml/HashNet/tree/master/caffe) and please extract the file in ./data/imagenet
